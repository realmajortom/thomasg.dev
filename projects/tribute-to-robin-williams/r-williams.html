        <p>I've written and rewritten my "tribute" Robin Williams for days now. It feels borderline sacrilegous to cram
          the expanse of his accomplishments and the depth of his legacy into a few paragrphs on a "learning-to-code"
          project. Instead of slathering a wall of generic biography-vomit, I'll share
          an experience of my own.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite movies growing up was <i>Hook</i>, with Robin Williams as Peter Pan. In the first part of
          the film, adult Peter winds up in Neverland. However, he has forgotton who he is and must take
          lessons from the Lost Boys on how to fight, fly, and crow. It's the only way he can rescue his children from
          Captain Hook.</p>
        <p>At the film's turning point, Peter remembers who his--he finds his Happy Thought. This awakening is ushered
          in with a
          hilarious food fight; Thud Butt flicks rainbow frosting and Pan, Latchboy chucks a fistful at Pockets and
          Donut, and mayhem is unleashed. The fight ends abruptly when a coconut soars towards Peter, who insinctively
          deflects it with his sword. Pan is back.</p>
        <p>Only Robin Williams could have pulled that off. The boyish joy he eminates in the film is tangible,
          contagious. As an adult, the scene still brings me the excitment I felt as a 6-year-old boy. I wish
          Robin could hear the laughs he brought to my home, and I'm sure many others feel the same.</p>
        <p>Bangarang, Robin!</p>
