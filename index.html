        <p>Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're
          going.
          Partially, but it also obeys your commands. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!
        </p>
        <p>Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like
          the
          Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
        <p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. I can't get
          involved!
          I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right
          now. It's
          such a long way from here.</p>
        <p>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were
          beamed
          to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. I'm trying not to, kid.
        </p>
        <p>You don't believe in the Force, do you? Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you,
          Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more
          star
          systems will slip through your fingers.</p>
        <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? The plans you refer to will soon be back
          in our
          hands. I find your lack of faith disturbing. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems
          will slip
          through your fingers.</p>
        <p>I'm trying not to, kid. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at,
          ain't it?
          The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home.
          It's
          late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
        <p>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of
          courage.
          It's more like…suicide. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.</p>
        <p>I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. No! Alderaan is
          peaceful.
          We have no weapons. You can't possibly… You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!</p>
        <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I
          can do
          about it right now. It's such a long way from here. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</p>
        <p>Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? She must have hidden the plans in the
          escape pod.
          Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us
          this time!
