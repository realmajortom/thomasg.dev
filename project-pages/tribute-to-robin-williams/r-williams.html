        <p>I've written and rewritten my "tribute" Robin Williams for days now. It feels borderline sacrilegous to cram
          the expanse of his accomplishments and the depth of his legacy into a few paragraphs on a "learning-to-code"
          project. Instead of slathering a wall of generic biography-vomit, I'll share
          an experience of my own.</p>
        <p>One of my favorite movies growing up was <i>Hook</i>, with Robin Williams as Peter Pan. At the beginning of
          the film, the children of Peter (now an adult) are kidnapped by Captain Hook in a scheme to finish off The
          Great Pan, once and for all. Tinkerbell travels to London, hunts down Peter, and carries him off to Neverland
          to rescue his kids. However, Peter has forgotton his past life as a Lost Boy and must
          learn on how to fight, fly, and crow.</p>
        <p>At the film's turning point, Peter finds his Happy Thought and remembers who he really is. This awakening is
          ushered
          in with a
          brilliantly colorful food fight; Thud Butt flicks rainbow frosting and Pan, Latchboy chucks a fistful at
          Pockets and
          Donut, and mayhem is unleashed. The fight ends abruptly when a coconut soars towards Peter, who insinctively
          deflects it with his sword. Pan is back.</p>
        <p>Robin Williams is likely the only man who could have believably brought the ultimate boy--Peter Pan--back to
          life. The joy and wonder he eminates in the film is tangible,
          contagious. As an adult, the scene still brings me the excitment I felt as a 6-year-old boy. It makes me want
          to embrace my own happy thoughts! What a gift Robin Williams was to the world.</p>
        <p>Bangarang, Robin!</p>
